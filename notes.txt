The next step is to write some test cases. We simply want the tokenizer and parser to produce some
result, but not examine them in any way. We will then write the syntax checker, which will do the
same thing.

I think it is possible to maket the parser continuation-based. Let's check that out.



I'm stuck on the module system
I'm stuck on two components
  The recursive nature
  How to report errors
We could make it non recursive
Declarations are recursive up to `open`

Let's implement a meta-system
  unit
    <body>
  open unit
The problem with this is scoping

We could parameterize modules only by types
We could
